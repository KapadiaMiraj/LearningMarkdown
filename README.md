# Lists

**Unordered List :**
* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes

**Ordered List :**
1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

**Nested List :**
* Tintin
  * A reporter
  * Has poofy orange hair
  * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock
  * A sea captain
  * Has a fantastic beard
  * Loves whiskey
    * Possibly also scotch?

**Complex Nesting Example:**
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

   Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

   If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

   Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

   By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.

   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   * Make sure no trout or children are present
   * Use both hands
   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes
